You can run NUnit tests using:
1. ReSharper's built-in test runner.
2. Official NUnit Test Adapter (https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d).
   Select Test -> Run menu item.
3. Standalone NUnit test runner (http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download). You need to pass a compiled assembly with
   tests to the runner.
